## Project Overview

This project focuses on detecting anomalies in network traffic data. It aims to identify unusual patterns that may indicate security threats, network failures, or other abnormal activities. By employing various machine learning and statistical techniques, the project provides insights into network behavior and helps improve network security and performance.

## Goals

*   Develop and implement effective anomaly detection techniques for network data.
*   Provide a user-friendly interface for analyzing network traffic and visualizing anomalies.
*   Create a flexible and extensible framework that can be adapted to different network environments.
*   Offer clear and actionable insights for network administrators and security professionals.

## Key Features

*   **Multiple Anomaly Detection Techniques:** Implements a variety of techniques including statistical methods, machine learning algorithms, and deep learning models.
*   **Real-time Analysis:** Capable of analyzing network traffic in real-time or near real-time (implementation dependent).
*   **Data Visualization:** Provides interactive visualizations to help users understand and interpret the detected anomalies.
*   **Customizable Thresholds:** Allows users to set custom thresholds for anomaly detection based on their specific network environment.
*   **Alerting System:** Generates alerts when anomalies are detected, notifying administrators of potential issues.

## Methodology

The anomaly detection process involves the following steps:

1.  **Data Collection:** Gathering network traffic data from various sources (e.g., network devices, logs).
2.  **Data Preprocessing:** Cleaning and transforming the data to make it suitable for analysis. This includes handling missing values, normalizing data, and feature extraction.
3.  **Model Training:** Training anomaly detection models using historical network traffic data.
4.  **Anomaly Detection:** Applying the trained models to new network traffic data to identify anomalies.
5.  **Visualization and Reporting:** Presenting the detected anomalies in a clear and informative way, along with relevant statistics and visualizations.

> *   **Dataset 2:** [Dataset Name]. Description of the dataset, including its source, size, and key features.
> *   **Note:** Add more datasets as needed. Provide links to download the datasets if they are publicly available. If the datasets are not public, describe how they can be obtained or generated.

Example:

*   **NSL-KDD:** A popular dataset for network intrusion detection. It contains a wide variety of network traffic data with labeled anomalies. Source: [https://www.unb.ca/cic/datasets/nsl.html](https://www.unb.ca/cic/datasets/nsl.html)

## Anomaly Detection Techniques

The following anomaly detection techniques are implemented in this project:

*   **Statistical Methods:**
    *   **Moving Average:** Detects anomalies based on deviations from the moving average of network traffic metrics.
    *   **Z-Score:** Identifies anomalies based on the number of standard deviations from the mean.
*   **Machine Learning Algorithms:**
    *   **Isolation Forest:** An unsupervised learning algorithm that isolates anomalies by randomly partitioning the data.
    *   **One-Class SVM:** A support vector machine that learns a boundary around normal data points and identifies outliers.
    *   **Local Outlier Factor (LOF):** Detects anomalies based on the local density of data points.
*   **Deep Learning Models:**
    *   **Autoencoders:** Neural networks that learn to reconstruct normal network traffic and identify anomalies based on reconstruction error.

## Interpreting Results

The output of the anomaly detection techniques typically includes an anomaly score for each data point. Higher scores indicate a higher likelihood of being an anomaly.

*   **Anomaly Score Threshold:** A threshold is used to classify data points as either normal or anomalous. The threshold can be adjusted based on the desired sensitivity and specificity of the anomaly detection system.
*   **Visualization:** Visualizations such as scatter plots, line charts, and heatmaps can be used to explore the detected anomalies and identify patterns.
*   **Alerting:** When an anomaly is detected, an alert is generated, providing information about the type of anomaly, the time of occurrence, and the affected network resources.  Consider implementing a scoring system and adjusting thresholds based on false positive/negative rates.

> Add any other dependencies specific to your project.

Install the dependencies using pip:

bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/Anomaly-detection-in-Network.git
cd Anomaly-detection-in-Network
3.  **Activate the virtual environment:**

    > Place the datasets in the `data/` directory or modify the scripts to load the datasets from a different location. Ensure the data is appropriately formatted for the chosen anomaly detection techniques.

6.  **Configure the project:**

    > Modify the `config.yaml` file to set the desired parameters for data preprocessing, model training, and anomaly detection. Example parameters include the anomaly score threshold, feature selection methods, and model-specific hyperparameters.

## Usage Examples

1.  **Run the data preprocessing and anomaly detection script:**

bash
python scripts/detect_anomalies.py --config config.yaml --model isolation_forest --data data/new_data.csv --output results/anomalies.csv
> Replace `config.yaml`, `isolation_forest`, `data/new_data.csv`, and `results/anomalies.csv` with your desired configuration file, model name, input data file, and output file, respectively.  Add more specific examples for different models.  Consider creating a `run.sh` script for ease of use.
